# Map of GitHub

This is a map of 400,000+ GitHub projects. Each dot is a project. Dots are close to each other if they have a lot of common
stargazers.

## How was it made?


## Country names

A lot of country labels were generated with help of ChatGPT. If you find something wrong, you can right click it, edit, and send
a pull request - I'd be grateful.

The query that I used to generate labels was:

```
Please analyze these repository and detect a common theme (e.g. programming language, technology, domain). Pay attention to language too (english, chinese, korean, etc.). If there is no common theme found, please say so. Otherwise, If you can find a strong signal for a common theme please come up with a specific name for imaginary country that contains all these repositories. Give a few options.
```
